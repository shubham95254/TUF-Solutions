## 📝 Problem Statement

Given an n x m matrix grid where each cell contains either 0 or 1, determine the shortest distance between a source cell and a destination cell. You can move to an adjacent cell (up, down, left, or right) if that adjacent cell has a value of 1. The path can only be created out of cells containing 1. If the destination cell is not reachable from the source cell, return -1.

### Example 1

<p>

**Input:** grid = [[1, 1, 1, 1],[1, 1, 0, 1],[1, 1, 1, 1],[1, 1, 0, 0],[1, 0, 0, 1]], source = [0, 1], destination = [2, 2]</p><p>

**Output:** 3</p><p>

**Explanation:** The shortest path from (0, 1) to (2, 2) is:</p>Move down to (1, 1)

Move down to (2, 1)

Move right to (2, 2)

Thus, the shortest distance is 3

### Example 2

<p>

**Input:** grid = [[1, 1, 1, 1, 1],[1, 1, 1, 1, 1],[1, 1, 1, 1, 0],[1, 0, 1, 0, 1]], source = [0, 0], destination = [3, 4]</p><p>

**Output:** -1</p><p>

**Explanation:** </p>Since, there is no path possible between the source cell and the destination cell, hence we return -1.

### Constraints

- 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500
- grid[i][j] == 0 or grid[i][j] == 1
- The source and destination cells are always inside the given matrix.
