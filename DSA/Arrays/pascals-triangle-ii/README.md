## 📝 Problem Statement

Given an integer **r** , return all the values in the **r** ^ **th** **row** (1-indexed) **** in Pascal's Triangle in correct order.

In **Pascal's triangle** :

- The **first** row has one element with a value of **1** .

- Each row has one more **** element in it than its **previous** row.

- The value of each element is equal **** to the sum **** of the elements directly **** above it when arranged in a triangle format.

### Example 1:

**Input:** r = 4

**Output:** [1, 3, 3, 1]

**Explanation:**

The Pascal's Triangle is as follows:

1

1 1

1 2 1

1 3 3 1

....

Thus the 4th row is [1, 3, 3, 1]

### Example 2:

**Input:** r = 5

**Output:** [1, 4, 6, 4, 1]

**Explanation:**

The Pascal's Triangle is as follows:

1

1 1

1 2 1

1 3 3 1

1 4 6 4 1

....

Thus the 5th row is [1, 4, 6, 4, 1]

Still unsure what the problem is asking ?

Let’s go through a few more examples, step by step, to make it clearer.

### Constraints

- 1 <= r <= 30
- All values will fit inside a 32-bit integer.
